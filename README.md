PROJECTS: 

1. Wall Destroyer Extended / walldestroyer100loleditionv2

The unofficial recode and expansion of Wall Destroyer, an incremental game made by Tellurium in the Idle Game Maker engine.
IGM WDE is going to be abandoned in favor of a JavaScript rewrite, which was supposed to be accomplished with the release of Wall Destroyer: Real Edition
